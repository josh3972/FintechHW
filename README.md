# TITLE
## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
WalletHub
* When was the company incorporated?
The company was founded back in August of 2013.

* Who are the founders of the company?
Odysseas Papadimitriou, hailing from his previous startup of CardHub, later ventured on to create wallethub.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

After Odysseas' successful launch of CardHub, he felt he could do something more, which would intertwine CardHub, which mainly compared
credit card to eachother, the idea that came to fruition was, "Why not intertwine personal finance with credit card comparision?" 
This ultimately led to the absorption of CardHub into the WalletHub that we know so well today.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    The company was funded through its parent company, Evolution Finance.
    It is not stated how much funding they've received as investment records into WalletHub have turned up bleak. They are a private, for-profit company.

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    WalletHub simply tries to aid those treading the water in personal finance to better understand their current situation,
    and if needed, how to improve it. This is critical in today's society as everything revolves  around credit.
    To simply put it, without credit, you just cant live. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    There isnt a solid number on how many users they have; however, the intended customer is the average joe, looking for a nice way to get their free credit score.
    No other competitor offers a free DAILY credit score, in which WalletHub uniquely takes the 1st place in. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    Other than leveraging vantagescore 3.0's scoring mechanism, it does not note that they use much other propritary technology; however, there is a score simulator which looks like it incorporate a form of 
    AI into its algorithm to help predict your score if certain actions are taken, both negative and positive. 

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    This company lies within the diversified financial sector in which many of the personal finance based fintech companies also lie. Since they do not offer
    financial services directly, the appropation for their group remains valid.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    One of the innovations WalletHub has pioneered, effectively, to its users, would have to be the free vantagescore 3.0 
    which pulls from transunion, daily, for its users. On top of that, also providing ways to increase or streghten your credit if it is not where you'd like it to be.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    Other companies which do compete with WalletHub include, NerdWallet, CreditKarma, CreditSesame, and many others. 
    Of course, these companies have been around longer and are well known; however, with WalletHub is offering it is guaranteed to boom.

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    Amassing users who would like to see an updated credit report (transunion) daily, at absolutely no cost.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    Revenue is definitely the big factor here; however, WalletHub, being fairly new comparing to the others, hasn't amassed a huge revenue, though it is growing.
    They are sitting at an estimated 2.4M dollar revenue yearly. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    Not as well, simply because of the advertising set in place. There are commercials for CreditKarma and whatnot which is generally why they have such a huge base.
    I predict in the future, if no more competitors opt for a daily free score, WalletHub may soon take the throne.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    Offer 3 bureau free score daily! Also to incorporate more advertising, in a society where ads literally make up nearly everything, it can help bring traction over to the company.
    Additional traction, means that the company can get more sponsors from major credit card companies, and scale to fit an even larger consumer base. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    It would clearly help a lot of people out, credit monitoring with daily updates isn't cheap, and is definitely something many americans cannot afford.
    They would be seen as the company that is actually doing something to help, rather than take, in the end, if more Americans are financially responsible, it leads to a higher GDP per capita (historically)
    which means a higher GDP for the nation, everyone wins here. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    Artificial intelligence can also be used to create a Proprietary scoring system in which is unique to wallethub, they could then partner with lenders in order for those scores to actually be validated and used towards something.


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    It can take historical data, and make a choice whether or not the score should be ranging from a low one to a high one; taking the human out of the equation solves a lot of uncertainty issues in this scenario.
